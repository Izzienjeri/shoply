## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
2.  **`pipenv`:** Python dependency management tool. Install it via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pipenv
    # or (if using user install)
    python -m pip install --user pipenv
    ```
3.  **Node.js:** Version 18 or higher (includes npm). (You can use `nvm` to manage Node versions).
4.  **MySQL Server:** A running MySQL database instance.
5.  **`ngrok`:** A tool to expose local servers to the internet. Download from [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/). You'll need a free account.
6.  **Daraja Developer Account:** Register at [Safaricom Developers Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/) to get API credentials (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret) for the Sandbox environment.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Izzienjeri/shoply.git
cd shoply
```

### 2. Backend Setup (`server/` directory)

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd server
```

#### a. Install Dependencies using `pipenv`

`pipenv` manages dependencies and creates a virtual environment.

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```
*(This installs both regular and development dependencies specified in the `Pipfile`)*

#### b. Activate the Virtual Environment

To run backend commands, you need to be inside the virtual environment managed by `pipenv`.

```bash
pipenv shell
```
*(You should see your shell prompt change, indicating you're in the environment)*

#### c. Configure Environment Variables (`.env` file)

*   Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory.
*   Copy the contents from a template file if available (e.g., `.env.example`), or add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values:

    ```ini
    # Flask Configuration
    SECRET_KEY='your_strong_random_secret_key' # Important for session security
    JWT_SECRET_KEY='your_strong_random_jwt_secret_key' # Important for JWT security

    # Database Configuration (Update with your MySQL details)
    DATABASE_USER='your_mysql_username'
    DATABASE_PASSWORD='your_mysql_password'
    DATABASE_HOST='localhost' # Or your DB host IP/domain
    DATABASE_PORT='3306' # Default MySQL port
    DATABASE_NAME='shoply_db' # Choose a name for your database

    # Daraja API Credentials (Get these from Safaricom Developer Portal)
    DARAJA_ENVIRONMENT='sandbox' # Use 'sandbox' for testing, 'production' for live
    DARAJA_CONSUMER_KEY='your_safaricom_consumer_key'
    DARAJA_CONSUMER_SECRET='your_safaricom_consumer_secret'
    DARAJA_SHORTCODE='your_business_shortcode' # e.g., 174379 for sandbox
    DARAJA_PASSKEY='your_lipa_na_mpesa_online_passkey' # From the portal
    DARAJA_TRANSACTION_TYPE='CustomerPayBillOnline' # Usually this for STK Push

    # Daraja Callback URL (IMPORTANT - see Ngrok section below)
    DARAJA_CALLBACK_URL_BASE='<your_ngrok_https_url>' # Example: https://abcdef123456.ngrok-free.app
    ```

#### d. Set up `ngrok` for Daraja Callbacks

The Daraja API needs a publicly accessible URL to send payment confirmation callbacks *to your local machine*. `ngrok` provides this.

1.  **Start ngrok:** Open a *new separate terminal* (do not close your `pipenv shell` terminal) and run:
    ```bash
    ngrok http 5000
    ```
    *(This exposes your local port 5000, where the Flask app runs by default)*
2.  **Copy the HTTPS URL:** `ngrok` will display forwarding URLs. Copy the `https://` URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok-free.app`).
3.  **Update `.env`:** Paste the copied `ngrok` HTTPS URL into the `DARAJA_CALLBACK_URL_BASE` variable in your `server/.env` file.
4.  **Keep ngrok running:** Leave this `ngrok` terminal window open while you are developing and testing payments.

#### e. Database Setup

1.  **Create the Database:** Manually create the database specified in your `.env` file (`DATABASE_NAME`) using a MySQL client (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or the command line).
    ```sql
    -- Example SQL command:
    CREATE DATABASE artistry_haven_db;
    ```
2.  **Apply Migrations:** Run the database migrations to create the tables. Make sure you are in the `pipenv shell` (`cd server` then `pipenv shell`).
    ```bash
    flask db upgrade
    ```

#### f. Seed the Database (Optional but Recommended)

Populate the database with initial sample data (artists, artworks, users). Ensure the image files mentioned in `seed.py` exist in the `server/media/artwork_images/` folder.

```bash
flask seed
```
*Note: The default password for seeded users is `pass123`.*

### 3. Frontend Setup (`main/` directory)

Navigate to the frontend directory in a *new terminal* (or exit the `pipenv shell` in the backend terminal first using `exit`):

```bash
cd ../main # Assuming you are in server/, otherwise navigate to the 'main' directory
```

#### a. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# OR if you prefer yarn
# yarn install
```

#### b. Configure Environment Variables (`.env.local` file)

*   Create a `.env.local` file in the `main/` directory.
*   Add the following variable, pointing to your running backend API:

    ```ini
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    ```
    *(Ensure the port matches where your Flask backend is running)*

## Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    *   Open a terminal.
    *   Navigate to the `server/` directory (`cd path/to/your/project/server`).
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `pipenv shell`.
    *   Start the Flask development server:
        ```bash
        flask run
        ```
    *   The backend should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    *   Open a *separate* terminal.
    *   Navigate to the `main/` directory (`cd path/to/your/project/main`).
    *   Start the Next.js development server:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # OR if using yarn
        # yarn dev
        ```
    *   The frontend should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Access the Application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

4.  **Remember:** Keep the `ngrok` tunnel running in its terminal if you plan to test M-Pesa payments.

## Key Concepts for Beginners

*   **`pipenv`:** This tool helps manage the specific Python libraries (dependencies) your backend needs. It creates an isolated environment (`virtualenv`) so project dependencies don't clash with other Python projects on your system.
    *   `pipenv install`: Installs dependencies listed in the `Pipfile`.
    *   `pipenv shell`: Activates the isolated environment for the project. You run `flask` commands inside this shell.
    *   `Pipfile` & `Pipfile.lock`: Files that define and lock down your project's dependencies.
*   **`.env` Files:** These files store configuration secrets (like API keys, database passwords) outside of your code. This is crucial for security â€“ **never commit `.env` files to Git**.
*   **`ngrok`:** When testing features like webhooks or callbacks (like the one from Daraja), the external service needs to send a message *back* to your local computer. Since your computer isn't usually directly accessible from the internet, `ngrok` creates a secure tunnel, giving you a temporary public URL that forwards traffic to your local development server.
*   **Flask Migrations (`flask db upgrade`):** SQLAlchemy (the ORM) defines your database tables in Python code (models). Migrations are scripts (managed by Flask-Migrate/Alembic) that apply changes from your models to the actual database schema. `flask db upgrade` runs these scripts to keep your database structure in sync with your code.
*   **Seeding (`flask seed`):** This process populates your database with initial dummy data, making it easier to test the application without manually creating users, products, etc.

## API Endpoints Overview

The backend provides the following main API endpoint groups under the `/api` prefix (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api/...`):

*   `/auth`: User registration (`signup`), login (`login`), logout (`logout`).
*   `/artists`: List and get details for artists.
*   `/artworks`: List, get details, create, update, delete artworks.
*   `/cart`: Get cart contents, add items, update item quantity, remove items.
*   `/orders`: List user's orders, initiate checkout (POST).
*   `/payments`: Handles the Daraja callback (`/callback`).
